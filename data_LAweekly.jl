While not quite a full reversal, in the case of \"One Day at a Time: Manny Farber and Termite Art,\" the essay definitely came first. Manny Farber (1917-2008) was a noted critic of art and especially of film, as well as a talented and prolific painter, whose maverick style in both pigment and prose was impassioned and subversive, academically rigorous and flat-out gorgeous. In 1962 he wrote a landmark essay in which he coined the phrase \"termite art\" in making a case for visual and cinematic art that luxuriates in details of ordinary existence rather than chasing the elusive, vainglorious masterpiece. Directly inspired by the ideas Farber laid out, this exhibit was curated by Helen Molesworth and Rebecca Lowery (who leads tonight's walkthrough), and features examples of Farber's work along with some 30 other artists working in painting, sculpture, photography, film, video and sound, dating from the 1950s to the present.", "url": "https://www.laweekly.com/event/one-day-at-a-time-manny-farber-and-termite-art-9978286", "orgName": null, "ticket_info": [{"lowestPrice": "0"}, {"highestPrice": "0"}], "id": "LAweekly_252513ff84ae8fa2de6f7fcd8ba31bba"}

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

Lasworth\u2019s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist\u2019s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 \u2013 7:00 pm.\n\nLasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading.  Lasworth\u2019s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. \nThe event is free and open to the public.", "url": "https://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715", "orgName": null, "ticket_info": [{"lowestPrice": "0"}, {"highestPrice": "0"}], "id": "LAweekly_82eb420dedd974dfd93e189bdccd02d7"}

Like Persian miniatures, Bustamante\u2019s paintings are elaborate and enticing. Flowers from Mars combines carefully painted human-interpreted flora with otherworldly environments. The environments are constructed with washes of gouache and acrylic paint to create ethereal and atmospheric settings, where microscopic gardens float and flourish. Laurel finds abstraction to be more poetic in expressing nature than realism. Researching botanical motifs found in history is an important part of her process. By combining and contrasting highly rendered flora within atmospheric and abstract settings, she is exploring the schism in the human brain between our delight in nature and our global inability to maintain it. Each painting develops organically without a predetermined plan. The contrast between vaporous washes and tiny brushwork is extreme and requires a slow, contemplative process.\n\n\nLaurel Bustamante received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Southern Oregon University, Summa Cum Laude. In 2013, she was the finalist for the Portland Art Museum Contemporary Northwest Art Awards, in Portland Oregon.

Feuerman\nPerception\nJuly 15 \u2013 August 20, 2016\nOpening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 \u2013 9pm\n\nKM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called \u201cPerception\u201d the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 \u2013 August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series.\u00a0\n\nCarole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world\u2019s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970\u2019s with her photorealist paintings.\u00a0 Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture.\u00a0Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to\u00a0hyper-realistically\u00a0paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water.\n\nCarole Feuerman\u2019s\u00a0DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way.\n\nFeuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The\u00a0sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin.\n\nFeuerman\u2019s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.\n\nKM Fine Arts Los Angeles\n814 North La Cienega\nLos Angeles, CA. 90069\nPhone: 310-854-0540\n\nLA Gallery Hours:\nTuesday - Saturday 11am - 6 pm\n\nFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/kmfinearts/ \n@KMFineArts\n\nFor More Information, Contact:\nJennifer Gross\nEvolutionary Media Group\n323-658-8700\nJennifer@emgpr.com", "url": "https://www.laweekly.com/event/perception-7103466", "orgName": null, "ticket_info": [{"lowestPrice": "0"}, {"highestPrice": "0"}], "id": "LAweekly_64e89bddecd85f2e7b675cd3d137e0f3"}

The store\u2019s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI\u2019s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots.

The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \n\n\"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I\u2019ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb\u2019s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" \u2013 Cameron Watson, Director\n\nThe Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

In the voice there is a feeling of normality, like there is nothing wrong. What a good idea! I ease back the trigger; a torrent of sweat suddenly comes from nowhere and pours down my face. My hands are shaking; I gingerly put the gun down\u2026\u201d\n\nThus began an intimate relationship with Sophia, at that time I considered my Spirit Guide.

Blossoms and flower petals, still lifes, bulbous rock formations, studio figure models, all pass through the artist\u2019s eye and are stripped down to shape, pattern and color, the essential building blocks of Hoekzema\u2019s paintings.

EMAIL: info@barlinetours.com\n\nLos Angeles, March 8, 2017 || Exploring the artisanal food and beverage scene in Los Angeles has long been one of the city\u2019s premier pastimes. However, getting across town in a cheap and timely fashion has remained a challenge until the recent expansion of the Metro system. Enter Bar Line Tours.\n\nThe Los Angeles based tourism service is currently offering guided beverage and food tasting tours on the Expo and Gold lines, and will expand to feature some of the most eclectic neighborhood bars in the city, all by way of the Los Angeles Metro. \n\n\u201cThe idea was to show patrons the under-the-radar parts of the city, and the energy they contribute to the whole of Los Angeles. While expanding their palates at the same time,\u201d said founder and lead tour guide Tim Maher. \u201cYou can really get a feel for the vibe of the neighborhood by seeing what their bars specialize in.\u201d\n\nTours can be reserved at barlinetours.com and will take place on the Expo, Gold, Purple, and Red lines, with stops at several bars and restaurants within walking distance of the respective metro lines. However, the name of the game isn\u2019t speed drinking, it\u2019s working out everyone\u2019s tasting muscles. \u201cNow more than ever, people care about what they are eating and drinking,\u201d says Maher, who has an Environmental Science and Anthropology background, and has spent time bartending at the renowned Father\u2019s Office. \u201cAs artisans experiment with new recipes, people get even more adventurous and curious about what they want to eat and drink next.\u201d\n\nEND", "url": "https://www.laweekly.com/event/bar-line-tours-8005973", "orgName": null, "ticket_info": [{"lowestPrice": "89"}, {"highestPrice": "89"}], "id": "LAweekly_9b743408c3daf38ca6c5c9736bfaa670"}

Inside gallery walls, they transform into postminimalist studies in line and color, without losing any of their cheeky charm. \"Into the White Cube\" will survey some favorite works made over the last 20 years, alongside new work and experimental forays into other mediums and formats.

It's the 35th anniversary of the spooky Disney classic Something Wicked This Way Comes and to celebrate, Mad Monster Movie Night is presenting a screening and Q&A. The 1983 fantasy film, directed by Jack Clayton, was based on a Ray Bradbury novel and its literary feel is clearly no accident. The title was taken from a line in Shakespeare's Macbeth (\"By the pricking of my thumbs/Something wicked this way comes\") and though it's not a traditional horror film, its air of dread lives up to its ominous name thanks to a stellar cast (Jason Robards, Jonathan Pryce, Diane Ladd and Pam Grier) and a creepy carnival backdrop. Mr. Dark's Pandemonium Carnival, with its haunting, time-warping carousel and requisite freaks and oddities, is more than it seems, and it'll take the will of two young boys to save everyone as the carnival sets its sinister sights on their town as winter and wickedness approach. If you've never seen this one, don't miss it.
